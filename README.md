# Weather Application Geo Location

## Description

This is a dynamic Weather Application powered by the Open Weather API. Open Weather API is used to pull the live weather outlook for the city you are currently located in, so users can plan accordingly before going outside. Once you allow your location to be shared on your local machine, the City name you are located in populates below the current date. A brief overview also populates below the City containing the Humdity, Pressure, and Temperature outside currently. If you are looking ahead in the week, below the overview you are able to see the high and low temperatures of the 7 day week. Each time the user opens the app, a different background is rendered as well using the Unsplash API.
